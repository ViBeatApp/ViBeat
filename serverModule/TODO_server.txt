debugging:


1. next song when there are 2 songs doesn't stop the first song.
2. songs delay in relate to rendering.
3. between getReady and play there's a rendering just for setCurrentTrack.
4. If the server has fallen the client should comeback to main activity(with alert\toast)
5. Ido leaves and after that recieves a Sync command. (sync after leave - adding locks (?) )
6. Resume activity instead of recreate.
7. if offset is too big -> do next-song
8.swap

remarks:
1. touch current song. Do we need to send getReady after Songs list has changed.
2. search by name. (party)
3. A lot of callbacks.



99. Party's image at the client code.
100. facebook auth (in the end)
