debugging:

5. Ido leaves and after that recieves a Sync command. (sync after leave - adding locks (?) )
7. if offset is too big -> do next-song

remarks:
1. touch current song. Do we need to send getReady after Songs list has changed.
2. search by name. (party)
3. A lot of callbacks.



99. Party's image at the client code.
100. facebook auth (in the end)
